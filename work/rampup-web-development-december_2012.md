#RampUp

When I first joined Startup Institute in October 2012, I was tasked with creating a part-time web development program for students that were not ready to enter our full-time web development track.

I started out by interviewing interested students to find out what they wanted to learn. Then I began developing the curriculum, which ultimately developed into a 4-month curriculum where students received a new web-development lab every week. I was also tasked with developing and executing on the marketing of the program, the sales (it cost $200 a month per student), interviewing applicants to the program, scheduling instructors, working with another developer to iterate on the curriculum, and providing student support.

This was my first foray into web development myself. Though I was comfortable with Python and scripting, I learned all about web development through making this course, as well as learning about marketing, sales, and curriculum development, and community management. 

I ran the RampUp program from December 2012 to April 2013, when I handed it over to another coworker as I shifted towards more of a development role at the company. I continued to be a teacher in the program until August 2013, when I had to stop due to my all semester schedule at school.
