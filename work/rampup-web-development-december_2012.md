#RampUp

When I first joined Startup Institute in October 2012, I was tasked with creating a part-time web development program for students that were not ready to enter our full-time web development track.

I started out by interviewing interested students to find out what they wanted to learn. Then I began developing the curriculum, which ultimately developed into a 4-month curriculum where students received a new web development lab every week. I was also tasked with developing and executing on the marketing of the program, the sales (it cost $200 a month/student), interviewing applicants to the program, scheduling instructors, providing student support, and working with another developer to iterate on the curriculum.

This was my first foray into web development myself. Though I was comfortable with Python and scripting, I learned all about web development through making this course. In addition, I learned about marketing, sales, curriculum development, and community management. 

I ran the RampUp program from December 2012 to April 2013, when I handed it over to another co-worker when I shifted towards more of a development role at the company. I continued to be a teacher in the program until August 2013, when I had to stop due to my fall semester schedule at school.
