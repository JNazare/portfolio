#High School Camp

In April 2013, I proposed the idea of running a two-weekend crash course for high school students interested in computer science to my co-workers at Startup Institute. After getting board approval, I took the project from an idea through execution, which involved the marketing for the class, creating the curriculum, finding additional instructors, and finding a place to hold the class, food for the students, and laptops for students that did not have personal computers.

This workshop is where I got the idea to use basic natural language processing as a way to introduce students to basic coding concepts. Students used a web application I created to scrape (approximately) the last two years of text from their Facebook feeds. Then we taught them to basics of variables, for-loops, and if-statements in Python through an exercise where they processed their Facebook text to remove common words (i.e. stop words) and punctuation. Lastly, they posted their list of curated words back to the web application and it generated a word cloud that they could share with their friends on Facebook.

We received more interest than expected for this program -- 90 students signed up -- and we have to split the class into two groups over two weekends. It was an awesome experience to help these students write their first 100 lines of code, especially to see the excitement that they had when they saw their own Facebook feeds being parsed and remembered things they had said two years ago.
