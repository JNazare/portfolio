#Context vs. Content - Studying the Twitter Universe

Since May 2013, I have been working as a student researcher at the [MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Human Language Technology Group](http://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/cybersec/HLT/HLT.html) under the supervision of [Wade Shen](http://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/cybersec/HLT/biographies/shen-bio.html), specifically researching how we can characterize and cluster Twitter users based on the times of day they discuss certain topics on Twitter. This project is part of DARPA's Xdata project and I am currently working on revising and writing up the results to publish in a research paper.

This project is one of the ways that I became fascinated with natural language processing and the way we can use text to understand people. 

Through this project, I learned how to:
* Scope out my own research question, which was originally how we can auto-generate text from Twitter streams
* Refine my research question to meet the lab's research goals
* Write research code in Python and Scala
* Create and run scientifically sounds experiments on Amazon Turk in order to tag my data so it cold be used for validation
* Efficiently run code for big data sets (i.e. 6 million tweets)
* Present academic work
* Write an academic paper for publication (still working on this)
