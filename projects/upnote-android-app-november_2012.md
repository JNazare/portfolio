#UpNote Android App

For my Mobile Design and Development independent study, I created an app that streamlines the process of taking photos of the whiteboard and uploading them to the correct spot on Dropbox.

The inspiration for this app came from my Introduction to Circuits class, where we would scramble to copy circuit diagrams with 30+ transistors. Eventually, I started taking pictures of the circuits instead and uploading them to Dropbox for reference with my notes.It was a hassle since Dropbox would not let me easily name the photos or put them in the correct folder from my phone. So I decided to make an app to make this easier.
