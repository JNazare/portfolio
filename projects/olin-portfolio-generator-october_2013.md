#Olin Portfolio Generator

Its portfolio season for graduating seniors and I've been asked to help a few of my friends put their portfolios up on the web. I decided to build a web application that generates portfolios for students that don't know HTML/CSS/JS. It uses individual Markdown files to represent different projects and a simple file structure that allows students to edit their settings. My portfolio itself is actually a demo of the portfolio generator.
