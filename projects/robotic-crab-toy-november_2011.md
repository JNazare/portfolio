#Robotic Crab Toy

For our Design Nature course, I worked on of team of four to create a walking crab toy.

This project was my first exposure to User-Oriented Design, the process by which you design a product for a specific user group - in our case, fourth grade students.

We learned about incremental design during the course of this project. First, we created sketch models, then a working proof of concept, then the initial prototype, and finally constrcuted a final product and demoed it live to a forth grade audience (who graded us).
