#@IntroduceMeTo

@IntroduceMeTo was a half-semester project that employed data mining, parsing, natural language processing, and remote API integration to make a bot that brings professional introductions, usually made on LinkedIn (a professional social network), to Twitter, (a unidirectional communication network), where interacting with complete strangers is acceptable.
