#Refridgerated Bed

When you are asleep, does it matter if your whole room is air conditioned? Is all that energy expended really necessary? No. So why not just cool the space around your bed?

This was the concept that I worked with while an intern at Mozaic Design in the summer of 2011. The basic question was: How do you cool an area around a bed without cooling the entire room? And better yet, how do you do this with the resources available in Goa, a small, very humid state on the west coast of India.

When I began this project, I was the only one working on it, so I began with testing and choosing a cooling method. Once I decided on a method, I sourced materials from the bazaar in Panjim (the capital of Goa), and worked with a product designer to construct a functional prototype.
