#Weather Balloon System

For our Real World Measurements course, I worked on a small team to launch a weather balloon into the stratosphere and then retrieve images and data from the payload.

This project was my first exposure to systems design. We tackled the problem of how to understand, build, and integrate multiple systems such as a camera, a data acquisition device (DAQ), and a cell phone with GPS tracker, and learned how to ensure that these systems did not fail in the low temperature of the stratosphere.
