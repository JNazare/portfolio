#The Music Map

We spent 24 hours (straight) creating a way for users to spatially create radio stations, a method of music discovery not currently employed by popular music streamers such as Rdio and Spotify.

This project was my first introduction to Node.Js as well as to using big web APIs such as the EchoNest API and Rdio player.

Awards:
* 2nd Place, HackMIT
* Best UI, HackMIT
* Crowd Favorite, HackMIT
