#Curriculum Github

Since September 2013, I have been working a project nicknamed "Github for Curriculum," a web application that uses the power of Github's version control in a simple-to-use web application for people that do not use Github. This is a project that I am working on for Startup Institute, a education company with branches in New York, Chicago, and Boston.

I have built the web application in Node.Js, using the markdown parser Marked, ACE editor, and the Github v3 API. I have currently finished the first version of the application and am working through user testing with students and instructors that will be the end users of the application.
