#QR Encoder

For our Computer Architecture course, I worked on a team project to investigate bit-encoding and construct a working QR encoder in Python. From this project, we learned not only about how QR codes work, but also how to work effectivly on a four-person software development team and handeling typical problems such as merging four different sets of code and refactoring our code.
